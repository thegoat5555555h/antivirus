# Virus Scan Script

This script performs a virus scan on your computer using Windows Defender and provides an option to support the developer through a PayPal donation.

## How it works

1. The script initiates a virus scan using Windows Defender, specifically a Quick Scan with the threat level set to All.
2. After the scan is complete, the script displays a message indicating that the virus scan is finished.
3. It then prompts the user with an option to open a PayPal donation link to support the developer's work.
4. If the user chooses to open the PayPal link, their default web browser will launch, directing them to the donation page.
5. If the user chooses not to open the PayPal link, the script will exit.
6. The script also includes a pause command at the end to keep the terminal window open for review.

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system.
- Windows Defender, the built-in antivirus software on Windows, should be installed and up to date.

## Usage

1. Download the script and save it as a .bat file.
2. Double-click the .bat file to run the script.
3. The script will perform a virus scan and display the results.
4. Choose to open the PayPal link or exit the script.
